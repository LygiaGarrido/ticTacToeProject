  This project aims to improve programming skills in a team context within the MindSwap academy, where we developed a tic-tac-toe in java programming language that we created from scratch using the acquired knowledge and tools and problem solving until its presentation.


## How to Play Tic Tac Toe?

To play tic tac toe, you need a standard playing board and nine pieces. You start out by placing the X's and O's on the board. Then, you place the pieces on the board starting from the top left corner and move down and across until you reach the bottom right corner. Once you have placed all of the pieces, you take turns removing a piece from the board. Whoever removes the last piece wins!
